        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>With over a decade of experience in product marketing for the advertising technology industry, I have always had a desire to be more involved in product creation and am now transitioning into a career as a developer. Through my background in product marketing, I've developed valuable skills in project management, collaboration, and communication. Working closely with development teams has also given me a solid understanding of the software development process. I'm currently expanding my technical skills through a coding bootcamp and personal projects. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to the creation of innovative software. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to combine my marketing background with my newfound technical skills to create impactful solutions.</p>
